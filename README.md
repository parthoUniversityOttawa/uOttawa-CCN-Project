# Chat Application - using TCP-Socket


## Objective:
	Our project deals with the transfer of data/information in the Intradomain system using TCP/IP protocol.

	We will be using the socket programming interface that provides the routines required for the Interprocess communication between the applications in a TCP/IP based network environment.

	Furthermore we will be focussing on client-server architecture, which is a computing module in which the server hosts, delivers and manages most of the resources and services to be consumed by the client.



## Motivation:
	Process-to-process communication is the job of the transport layer protocol. 

	The application does not need to know how this is done. 

	The application simply uses the interface that the transport layer provides to it to send messages. 

	This interface is referred to as socket API.


## Application Exection:
	run - [sh run.sh]

## Output Excutable:
	app1C- Application 1 - acting as Client
	app2S- Application 2 - acting as Server.
